# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è QuestMaster: Interactive Narrative Generator with LLMs and Classical Planning
**QuestMaster** is a two-phase system designed to assist authors in creating logically consistent, interactive narrative quests. It integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for narrative and code generation with **classical planners (PDDL)** for logical structure and validation.

---

## üìú Overview

QuestMaster helps you:
1. **Design a rich, branching narrative** with user-defined constraints.
2. **Automatically generate PDDL domain & problem files** for logical consistency.
3. **Validate quests** using classical planning (e.g., Fast Downward).
4. **Deliver a playable HTML-based interactive story game** with dynamic storytelling.

## üõ† Architecture

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Story Generation
- **Input**:
  - `lore.md`: background story, initial state, goal, obstacles.
  - Configuration for branching factor & quest depth.

- **Pipeline**:
  1. LLM interprets lore and outputs `domain.pddl` and `problem.pddl`.
  2. Fast Downward planner checks for solvability (i.e. if the formulation allows at least one valid path from the initial state to a goal state).
  3. If invalid, the Reflection Agent iteratively corrects and refines the PDDL model.
  4. Updates `lore.txt` as needed.

- **Output**:
  - Validated `domain.pddl`, `problem.pddl`, and updated `lore.txt`.

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Interactive Story Game
- **Pipeline**:
  1. HTML/JS interface generated from PDDL plan and lore.
  2. Each state includes:
     - Description
     - Player options (branching)
     - Optionally, auto-generated images.

- **Output**:
  - `index.html`: standalone playable story.
  - Supporting JS/CSS files.
  - Optional assets (images, audio).
